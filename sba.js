//What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
// At the planning stage of my project, I should have allocte time more effectively, taking into account the potentential barriers during the process.

//Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
//Fixing the errors is quite challengeing. Future projects could benefit from a more comprehensive approach to exception management.

//What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
//If given more time, I'll focus on optimizing my code for better performers.

//Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:
//Notes for futre Projects:
//Document: Throughout the procees I  will keep detailed documentation for easier reference for my classmates or team members. I'll commit frequently inorder to catch errors before its hard to fix them.
